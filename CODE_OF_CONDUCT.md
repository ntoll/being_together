# Being Together

When being together,  
acknowledge and work through differences.

This mutually enlarges and changes us.

Therefore,

This is a place of learning, understanding, and sharing.  
This is a place to affirm openness and compassion.  
This is a place for collaborative creation.

Dear friend, please be true to yourself yet kind to others  
(even in the face of hostility).

Thank you.
