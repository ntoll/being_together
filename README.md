# On Being Together

A poetic expression of being together in a specific "place" (such as a software
project).

Sadly, in such divided times, folks may need reminding of an alternative way of
being together based on mutual respect, tolerance and compassion. Without such
things wonderfully diverse and rich groups of people cannot come together.

It's not a code of conduct, but like a code of conduct.

```
When working together or if things go wrong,  
we acknowledge and work through differences.  
In so doing, we transform and enlarge each other.

To nurture our mutual growth,

  this is a place of  
    learning, understanding, and sharing;  

  this is a place to  
    affirm tolerance and compassion;  

  this is a place for  
    collaborative creativity.

All the aspects of yourself you choose to bring to this place  
are welcome here.

Reciprocate! Welcome, embrace and learn from others  
(even in the face of apparent hostility or misunderstanding).

To act against this spirit invites ostracism, 
a loss that diminishes us all.

Thank you.
```
